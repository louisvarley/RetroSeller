# Welcome to Retro Seller

This is a dead simple stock manager and finance manager website i knocked up in 2 evenings to help myself and someoneelse handle some ebay selling 
keeping track of who bought what, who paid for what and so forth. 

Don't expect any of the following...

- Decent well-written coding
- Good solid security
- Robust libraries

Uses a https://github.com/daveh/php-mvc as its MVC engine as its simple and quick to get building. 

It does however mostly run on AJAX which is pretty good

On first launch it will check your database settings and auto setup all tables and views for you.
